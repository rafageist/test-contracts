# Test Contracts

**Test Contracts** introduces a theoretical framework for formalizing and organizing software testing. By defining **contracts** (interfaces) and **suites** (test implementations), this approach ensures consistent test coverage and establishes clear expectations for developers.

---

## Key Concepts

1. **Contracts**: 
   - These are interfaces that define the minimum requirements for what should be tested.
   - They act as a formal agreement, ensuring that every contract is implemented by a corresponding suite.
   - Contracts do not prescribe how the tests should be implemented, only what needs to be covered.

2. **Suites**:
   - Test classes that implement one or more contracts.
   - While suites may include additional tests beyond those specified by the contracts, they must at least implement all tests defined in the corresponding contract.

## Sources of Test Contracts

Test contracts can originate from various sources, providing flexibility and adaptability to different testing needs:

1. **External Test Plans**:
   - Platforms like Azure DevOps and others often define test cases as part of their test plans.
   - These test cases can be translated into contracts that describe the required test coverage for each scenario.
   - Documentation from test plans ensures traceability and clarity, helping developers understand what needs to be tested and why.

2. **Source Code Conventions**:
   - Development teams can establish conventions to identify testable components:
     - Service classes, where public methods should be covered by tests.
     - Data models, which can be tested for creation, property setting, and validation logic.
   - These conventions act as guidelines for generating or identifying contracts.

3. **Attributes and Markers**:
   - Attributes can be used to annotate methods or classes to highlight specific testing requirements.
   - For instance, parameters or conditions for testing different scenarios can be defined as attributes, helping to structure and organize the testing process.

## Development Team Conventions

To ensure consistency, teams can define specific conventions that guide the creation and implementation of test contracts:
- Scanning specific folders (e.g., models, services) to identify testable components.
- Establishing naming conventions for contracts and suites to streamline the testing workflow.
- Defining markers or annotations for special testing requirements, such as edge cases or performance testing.

## Benefits of Test Contracts

- **Formalized Testing Process**: Clearly defined contracts ensure that every important component is covered by tests.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Distinguishes between what needs to be tested (contracts) and how it is tested (suites).
- **Traceability**: Links between contracts and external test plans provide detailed context for developers.
- **Flexibility**: Supports testing at various levels, including unit tests, architectural tests, and more.
- **Team Alignment**: Provides a standardized approach that aligns the entire team around common testing goals.

## Test Contracts as the Software Representation of Test Plans and Test Cases

**TestContracts** can be seen as the software representation of traditional testing concepts like **test plans** and **test cases**, bridging the gap between formal testing definitions and their implementation in code. This analogy helps clarify the purpose and scope of TestContracts.

- **Test Plans**:
  - In traditional testing, a test plan outlines what needs to be tested, why it needs to be tested, and how it will be tested.
  - **TestContracts** translate these plans into formal interfaces in code, defining the scope and structure of what should be covered in testing.

- **Test Cases**:
  - Each test case in a traditional test plan becomes a contract or part of one, ensuring that the corresponding tests in suites meet the expected requirements.
  - These contracts provide a clear and traceable representation of the test case logic within the codebase.

- **Formal Testing Documentation**:
  - Just as test plans and test cases include steps, expected outcomes, and acceptance criteria, **TestContracts** incorporate these details directly into their structure.
  - This ensures developers have clear guidance and expectations while implementing tests.

### Key Differences from Traditional Testing Concepts

1. **Software-Based Representation**:
   - While test plans and test cases are typically maintained as documents or external configurations (e.g., in Azure DevOps), **Test Contracts** formalize these concepts as interfaces within the software itself.

2. **Automation and Standards**:
   - **Test Contracts** provide a standardized way to ensure consistency and traceability across teams, aligning testing efforts with both QA and development goals.

3. **Applicability Across Testing Levels**:
   - Unlike traditional test cases that may focus on specific levels of the testing pyramid, **Test Contracts** can represent requirements for unit tests, integration tests, architectural tests, performance tests, and more.

### Why This Matters

By aligning the software development process with formal testing definitions, **Test Contracts** ensure that testing is not merely an afterthought but a well-structured and integral part of development. They provide a unified language for QA and developers, ensuring clear expectations, consistency, and improved quality across all testing efforts.

## Future Directions

While this framework currently focuses on the theoretical aspects of organizing tests through contracts, it opens the door to future enhancements, such as:
- Automated tools to identify and define test contracts.
- Integration with external platforms for better traceability.
- Dynamic attributes for more complex testing scenarios.
